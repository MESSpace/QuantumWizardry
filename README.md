# QuantumWizardry
This is the mod for minecraft called QuantumWizardry!

# News:
As the mod is close to it's first public release, I may not be pushing changes for a while as none of the things I've made are completely implemented. As for the future of this mod, here's what's coming:

When the mod releases, the new features will be:
Quantum wands that create water and lava
Quantum Boss which activates the Awakened world
Awakened World with pink skies
Foundation for new items that can only be crafted in the awakened world.
Stronger mobs in the awakened world

Plans for after the mod releases:
Semi-automated quantum energy
Rechargable quantum energizer (dropped by Quantum boss)
Quantum Amulets that give potion effects (only available after awakened)
Mechanic to deactivate Awakened world(but keep awakened items)

As you can see, there's a lot planned for this mod, but it'll take a long time. I plan to add an API for this in the future, but I can't do that until the beginning items of the mod are finished, and I'll need some help debugging and fixing that stuff. That's where the next section comes in.

# Pull Requests
Even though this mod isn't popular at all, I'm putting this out there for the people who might discover this. From this point on, I'm accepting Pull Requests that optimize code, fix code, or localize the mod. This means that if you see a small bit in my mod that causes lag in the mod and could be achieved in a way that doesn't cause lag, feel free to fix it!(this is just an example, other things can be seen as fixes or optimizations) This also means that if you feel this mod should be in different languages, feel free to add those files in. This does NOT mean that you can go ahead adding items or changing unnecessary things. Remember, I check the code you've written before accepting or denying your code.

# Suggestions
Last but not least, suggestions. If you feel like anything should be added to the mod, feel free to send me a message! I'm not exactly sure how we're going to work that out, but I always read the messages I get on YouTube, so just find me there (guess what, my channel's name is MESSpace!) and send me a PM with your idea. I may make something like a secondary email account to accept suggestions, but for now we're sticking to PM's.
